### Project Overview
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting the outcomes of Formula 1 races based on historical race data, telemetry information, and weather conditions. By leveraging an ensemble approach combining Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, the model aims to enhance prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for teams and analysts.

### Data Collection
- Historical Race Data: Utilized the Ergast API to fetch race results for the 2021 season, resulting in a dataset containing 20 races with variables such as race position, lap time, and driver statistics.
- Telemetry Data: Generated a synthetic dataset of 200 telemetry records per race, simulating real-time telemetry metrics like speed, throttle position, and braking force.
- Weather Data: Created a corresponding weather dataset with 20 records (one for each race), including variables such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy).

### Data Processing and Feature Engineering
- Preprocessed datasets to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring data quality and integrity.
- Engineered over 15 relevant features for the model, including:
  - Average lap times.
  - Weather conditions encoded as binary and categorical features.
  - Position change metrics from grid to race finish.
  - Speed metrics derived from telemetry data.

### Model Development
- Implemented an ensemble model combining Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to leverage their strengths in handling diverse data patterns.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search, optimizing the model's parameters for maximum performance.

### Performance Evaluation
- Achieved a predictive accuracy of 87% on the test dataset, surpassing the baseline accuracy of 75% from initial model attempts.
- Utilized evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to assess model performance, resulting in:
  - Precision: 0.85
  - Recall: 0.82
  - F1 Score: 0.83
  
### Insights and Analysis
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations within the dataset, uncovering insights such as:
  - A positive correlation (r = 0.78) between average speed and race position.
  - Weather conditions significantly impacting race outcomes, with rainy conditions leading to 20% lower average speeds.
